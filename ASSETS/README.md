This folder needs to be present in the directory where the application runs. 

## Bitmap Fonts ##

Fonts are stored in bitmap format and extracted by the application and blitted into individual characters as needed.

There are two font files:

 * white.bmp *- real filename imonlcd_white.bmp*
 * black.bmp *- real filename imonlcd_black.bmp*

These are simply inverted colour versions of each other and are renamed from the original since some platforms (at least Atari ST TOS) are limited to 8 + 3 character file naming standards.
