# Tools #

Here are pre-built binaries (for Linux x86) of GCC toolchains for the following:

 * m68k Amiga OS - From: https://franke.ms/
 * m68k Atari TOS / GEM - From: http://tho-otto.de/crossmint.php and http://pmandin.atari.org/en/index.php?category/General


If you are just using the pre-build binaries of sdlLauncher and have no intention of recompiling the source code, you can safely delete this sub-folder.
